# TrussAnalysis
This is a program that is meant to take any input of a truss structure, 2d or 3d, with any load combination on the nodes(pin joined nodes), to analyze the element forces, nodal displacements, and reaction forces by the pinned reactions or the roller reactions(no support for the rigid supports). It also has the capabilities to store one's structure in a JSON file for easier access, and it graphs the results using matplotlib. Enjoy!
